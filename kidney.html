        <h3>THE SYMPTOMS FOR KIDNEY STONE</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
     <span style="color: red;">      Severe Pain:</span>  One of the most distinctive symptoms of kidney stones is severe pain, typically located in the back or the side below the ribs. The pain can radiate to the lower abdomen and groin area. The intensity of the pain can fluctuate and may come in waves.
     <br><br>
     <span style="color: red;">Painful Urination:</span>  People with kidney stones may experience pain or a burning sensation while urinating. The presence of stones in the urinary tract can irritate the urethra and bladder.
     <br><br>
        <span style="color: red;">Frequent Urination:</span>  There may be an increased urge to urinate, even when little urine is passed.
        <br><br>
            <span style="color: red;">Hematuria:</span>  Blood in the urine (hematuria) is a common symptom of kidney stones. The urine may appear pink, red, or brown due to the presence of blood.
            <br><br>
                <span style="color: red;">Cloudy or Foul-Smelling Urine:</span>  Kidney stones can cause changes in the appearance and odor of urine.
        </p>
        <h1>TABLETS</h1>
        <p>
            <span style="color: red;">   Pain Relief:</span>  <br>

                <span style="color: yellow;">  Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs):</span>   NSAIDs like ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) can help manage pain and inflammation associated with kidney stones.
                 <br>   <span style="color: yellow;">  Opioid Pain Medications:</span>   In cases of severe pain, healthcare providers may prescribe stronger pain relievers, such as oxycodone or hydrocodone. These medications are typically used for short periods due to their potential for addiction and side effects.
                 <br>       <span style="color: yellow;">  Alpha Blockers:</span>   Medications like tamsulosin (Flomax) can help relax the muscles in the ureter, making it easier for the stone to pass.

                   <br><br>         <span style="color: red;">  Intravenous (IV) Fluids:</span>   Hydration is crucial for kidney stone management. IV fluids may be administered in the hospital to ensure adequate hydration and facilitate the passage of smaller stones.

                    <br><br>            <span style="color: red;">  Medications to Alkalize Urine:</span>   Certain medications, such as potassium citrate, can help alkalize the urine, which may prevent the formation of certain types of kidney stones.
