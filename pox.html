 <h3 style="color: white;">CHICKEN POX SYMPTOMS</h3> 
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style="color: red;">
    1.Rash:</span> Chickenpox typically starts with a red rash that turns into itchy, fluid-filled blisters. The rash often begins on the face, chest, and back before spreading to other parts of the body.
<br><br><span style="color: red;">
2.Fever:</span> Fever is a common symptom accompanying the rash. The body temperature may rise above normal.
<br><br><span style="color: red;">
3.Fatigue:</span> Many people with chickenpox experience fatigue and a general feeling of being unwell.
<br><br><span style="color:red">
4.Headache:</span> Headaches can occur along with other flu-like symptoms.
<br><br><span style="color: red;">
5.Sore Throat:</span> Some individuals may have a sore throat or a cough.
<br><br><span style="color: red;">
6.Loss of Appetite:</span> Loss of appetite is common, especially in children.

 <br>
 <br>
 <h1 style="color: white; text-align: center;">TREATMENTS</h1>
 <p>
    <br><br><span style="color: red;">
    1.Antiviral Medications:</span> Antiviral medications like acyclovir can be prescribed by a healthcare provider, particularly for individuals at higher risk of complications, such as adults, pregnant women, or people with weakened immune systems. These medications can help reduce the severity and duration of the illness if taken early in the course of the infection.
<br><br><span style="color: red;">
2.Fever and Pain Relief:</span> Acetaminophen (Tylenol) can be used to reduce fever and relieve pain associated with chickenpox. Avoid giving aspirin to children with chickenpox due to the risk of Reye's syndrome, a rare but serious condition.
<br><br><span style="color: red;">
3.Calamine Lotion:</span> Calamine lotion can be applied to the itchy rash to soothe the skin and reduce itching.
<br><br><span style="color: red;">
4.Oatmeal Baths:</span> Taking a bath with colloidal oatmeal can help relieve itching and discomfort.
<br><br><span style="color: red;">
5.Antihistamines:</span> Over-the-counter antihistamines like diphenhydramine (Benadryl) can help reduce itching and improve sleep quality.
<br><br><span style="color: red;">
6.Maintain Hydration:</span> It's essential to stay well-hydrated, especially if there is a fever.
<br><br><span style="color: red;">
7.Avoid Scratching:</span> It's important not to scratch the blisters to prevent secondary bacterial infections and scarring. Keep fingernails short and consider wearing gloves at night to prevent scratching during sleep.
