        <H3 style="color: white;">THE TYPICAL SYMPTOMS FOR COLD:</H3>
        <p><span style="color:red">1.Runny or Stuffy Nose:</span> Nasal congestion is a hallmark symptom of a cold. The mucus membranes in your nose and throat become inflamed, leading to congestion.

 <br>  <br><span style="color: red;">       2.Sneezing:</span> The irritation in your nasal passages can trigger frequent sneezing.
            
  <br> <br><span style="color:red">         3.Sore Throat:</span> Postnasal drip (mucus dripping down the throat) can cause a sore or scratchy throat.
            
 <br>  <br><span style="color: red;">         4.Coughing:</span> Coughing helps clear your throat and airways from mucus buildup.
            
  <br>  <br><span style="color: red;">        5.Watery Eyes:</span> Irritation in the nasal passages can lead to watery eyes.
            
  <br>  <br><span style="color: red;">        6.Fatigue:</span> Colds often cause mild to moderate fatigue due to the body's immune response.
            
  <br>  <br><span style="color:red">        7.Headache:</span> Sinus congestion can cause headaches.
            
  <br>  <br><span style="color: red;">       8.Mild Body Aches:</span> Some people experience mild body aches and pains.</p>

        <h1 style="text-align: center; color: white;">TABLETS</h1>
        <p>
           <span style="color:red"> 1.Decongestants:</span> Decongestant tablets, such as pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) or phenylephrine, help relieve nasal congestion by narrowing blood vessels in the nasal passages. They are available in various formulations.
<br><br><span style="color: red;">
2.Antihistamines:</span> Antihistamine tablets, like diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or loratadine (Claritin), can help alleviate sneezing, runny nose, and itching. They work by blocking the action of histamine, a substance the body releases during an allergic reaction.
<br><br><span style="color:red">
3.Cough Suppressants:</span> Cough suppressant tablets often contain dextromethorphan, which helps reduce the urge to cough. These tablets can help control coughing fits.
<br><br><span style="color:red">
4.Expectorants:</span> Expectorant tablets, such as guaifenesin (Mucinex), help loosen mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up and clear the respiratory passages.
<br><br><span style="color: red;">
5.Pain Relievers/Fever Reducers:</span> Tablets containing acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) can reduce fever, alleviate headaches, and relieve body aches associated with a cold.
<br><br><span style="color: red;">
6.Multi-Symptom Cold Tablets:</span> Some OTC medications are formulated to address multiple cold symptoms. These combination tablets often contain a mix of decongestants, antihistamines, cough suppressants, and pain relievers.
