            <span style="color:red">     Antacids:</span> Antacids neutralize stomach acid and can provide quick relief from heartburn and indigestion. They are available in various forms, including tablets, chewable tablets, and liquids. Examples include Tums, Maalox, and Mylanta.
<br><br>
<span style="color:red">H2 Blockers:</span> Histamine H2-receptor blockers reduce stomach acid production, providing longer-lasting relief than antacids. They are often used to treat conditions like heartburn and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Examples include ranitidine (Zantac) and famotidine (Pepcid).
<br><br>
<span style="color:red">Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs):</span> PPIs are strong acid reducers and are used to treat conditions such as GERD, ulcers, and gastritis. They are typically taken before a meal. Examples include omeprazole (Prilosec), esomeprazole (Nexium), and lansoprazole (Prevacid).
<br><br>
<span style="color:red">Digestive Enzymes:</span> Digestive enzyme supplements can help improve digestion, especially in individuals with conditions like pancreatic insufficiency. These supplements are available in tablet form.
