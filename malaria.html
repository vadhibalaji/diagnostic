        <h3>THE SYMPTOMS OF MALARIA:</h3>
        <p>
          <span style="color: red;"> Fever:</span> Fever is one of the hallmark symptoms of malaria. It typically occurs in cycles, with the person experiencing fever and chills followed by periods of sweating and a return to normal body temperature. These cycles can vary in duration depending on the type of Plasmodium parasite causing the infection.
<br><br>
<span style="color: red;">Chills and Sweats:</span> Many individuals with malaria experience sudden coldness and shivering followed by profuse sweating as the fever breaks.
<br><br>
<span style="color: red;">Headache:</span> Malaria often causes severe headaches, which can be accompanied by body aches and muscle pain.
<br><br>
<span style="color: red;">Fatigue:</span> Malaria can lead to extreme tiredness and weakness.
<br><br>
<span style="color: red;">Nausea and Vomiting:</span> Some people with malaria experience nausea, vomiting, and a lack of appetite.
<br><br>
<span style="color: red;">Abdominal Pain:</span> Malaria can cause abdominal pain, which may be accompanied by diarrhea.
<br><br>
<span style="color: red;">Jaundice:</span> In severe cases, malaria can lead to jaundice, characterized by yellowing of the skin and eyes due to liver dysfunction.
<br><br>
<span style="color: red;">Anemia:</span> Malaria can cause anemia, leading to pale skin, weakness, and fatigue.
<br><br>
<span style="color: red;">Confusion:</span> In severe cases, especially in children, malaria can cause confusion, seizures, and coma.

        <h1>TABLETS</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            <span style="color:red"> Artemisinin-Based Combination Therapies (ACTs):</span> ACTs are the most effective and widely used antimalarial medications. They combine an artemisinin derivative with another antimalarial drug. Examples include:
<br>
<span style="color:yellow">Artemether-Lumefantrine (Coartem)</span><br>
<span style="color:yellow">Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine</span><br>
<span style="color:yellow">Artesunate-Amodiaquine</span><br><br>
<span style="color:red"> Chloroquine:</span> Chloroquine was once the primary treatment for malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale, and Plasmodium malariae. However, due to widespread resistance, it is no longer effective in many regions.
<br><br>
<span style="color:red"> Mefloquine:</span> Mefloquine is used for the prevention and treatment of malaria. It is taken weekly as a prophylactic or as a treatment for acute malaria infection.
<br><br>
<span style="color:red"> Doxycycline:</span> Doxycycline is an antibiotic that can be used as a prophylactic medication to prevent malaria. It is taken daily and is suitable for travelers going to areas with chloroquine-resistant malaria.
