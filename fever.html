        <p>
 <br><span style="color: red;">           1.Acetaminophen (Tylenol):</span> Acetaminophen is a common fever reducer and pain reliever. It is generally considered safe when taken as directed. Always follow the dosing instructions on the packaging or as advised by a healthcare provider. Do not exceed the recommended dosage, as high doses can lead to liver damage.
<br><br> <span style="color: red;">
2.Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin):</span> Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can reduce fever, alleviate pain, and decrease inflammation. Like acetaminophen, it should be taken according to the recommended dosage and guidelines to avoid gastrointestinal issues.
<br><br><span style="color: red;">
3.Aspirin:</span> Aspirin is also an NSAID that can reduce fever and relieve pain. However, aspirin should not be given to children and teenagers with viral infections due to the risk of Reye's syndrome, a rare but serious condition.
